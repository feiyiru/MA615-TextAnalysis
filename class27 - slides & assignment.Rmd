## Class Assignment

Pick a book and carry out the analysis that was done in the first four chapters of 
[Text Mining with R](https://www.tidytextmining.com/tidytext.html).

Make sure that you get a book or a collection downloaded as text.  Make sure that you can organize the tokens as shown in Chapter 1 and that you can at least generate a histogram using the work frequencies.  Go as far as you can with the analysis.  Produce notes about what you have done and how.  Include comments about what your analysis shows.
